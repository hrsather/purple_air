EPA Slides Notes:
They averaged their data to 24 hours. Interesting
What is 90% completeness threshold? 
They removed points if over threshold 24 hours
Should I use their equation for correction?

Correlation paper:
For correlation, this assumes no lag. How do we input lag?
Interesting to use graphs for correlation. Maybe we can shift for lag?
