Notes from Sep 9th meeting
higher pollution at night
want to use mobile sensors. 20 mins at a time
PM = particulate matter
20 microns and higher is bad
Use kriging methods
Denver rotates air a lot. Try outwards


EPA Slides Notes:
They averaged their data to 24 hours. Interesting
What is 90% completeness threshold? 
They removed points if over threshold 24 hours
Should I use their equation for correction?

Correlation paper:
For correlation, this assumes no lag. How do we input lag?
Interesting to use graphs for correlation. Maybe we can shift for lag?


TODO:  
Use A-B sensor info for outliers.  
Try standardized and non-standardized clustering data.
Cross-correlation lagged functions.
Air now sensors comparison. EPA Sensors
