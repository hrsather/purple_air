Notes from Sep 9th meeting
higher pollution at night
want to use mobile sensors. 20 mins at a time
PM = particulate matter
20 microns and higher is bad
Use kriging methods
Denver rotates air a lot. Try outwards


EPA Slides Notes:
They averaged their data to 24 hours. Interesting
What is 90% completeness threshold? 
They removed points if over threshold 24 hours
Should I use their equation for correction?

Correlation paper:
For correlation, this assumes no lag. How do we input lag?
Interesting to use graphs for correlation. Maybe we can shift for lag?




# Steps for cleaning data:

1. Remove all obvious outliers (Where there is a single spike of 300 or more. Can also compare channels A and B)
2. Round datetime to nearest 10 minutes
3. Average all 10 minute times  
Question: Will this be alright or do we want to create a better method

# Steps for coorelation clustering
There is no python package that does this. Would this work?
1. Clean the data
2. Normalize the data. Make the mean zero and variance one
3. Find the correlation of each of the sensors. O(n^2)
4. Use standard clustering after this. Complete linkage, probably.

Then, display via gps coordinates to visualize correlations.  
Will this work?

TODO:  
Use A-B sensor info for outliers.  
Make 2 minute intervals.  DONE  
Avg left and right DONE

Try standardized and non-standardized clustering data.

Cross-correlation lagged functions.

Use ATM DONE
